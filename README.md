Rosemary - Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data
========================================================

## Introduction
run_analysis.R performs analysis on the [UCI HAR Dataset]
(http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
formed by collecting data from thirty subjects performing six activities, 
namely walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing and 
laying.

## Instructions
- Download the UCI HAR Dataset from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).
- Extract the dataset. A folder named UCI HAR Dataset will be created.
- Set the UCI HAR Dataset as the working directory. This can be done by using
the setwd() command in R.
- Please do not change any file names. 
- run_analysis.R makes use of the "plyr" package. This can be installed by 
the command `install.packages("plyr")`. The script loads it when needed.
